# Discord-token-loggers
Discord token loggers for both Windows and Mac OS X

These two scripts do what you'd expect: One logs discord tokens on Windows, and one logs tokens on Mac OS X.

Both scripts are based around the same idea:

1. Check through application files for discord oauth tokens
2. Validate said tokens
3. Send validated tokens to a discord webhook

Idk what else to say, they're pretty basic...
